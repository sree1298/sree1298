I am a graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving problems which has motivated me to transition to the tech industry, gain an entry-level role in cybersecurity and build a long-term career as a Cloud Security Engineer.

Completing the Google Cybersecurity Certification led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, or a related role.

I have outlined a list of lab projects I have completed and the skills I have developed from completing them.
